# eligibleEntitlementType
Offers in open data can be marked as requiring an entitlement type via `eligibleEntitlementType`. The same Offer may be applicable to multiple entitlement types, and the Customer must have at least one matching entitlement type to qualify for the Offer. Note that this property is in EARLY RELEASE AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE, as the [Customer Accounts proposal](https://github.com/openactive/customer-accounts) evolves.

This property can be used on: [`schema:Offer`](https://schema.org/Offer)

This property may include the values: [`skos:Concept`](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept)

For more information, see the [developer documentation](https://developer.openactive.io/data-model/types/).
