# idTemplate
An RFC6570 compliant URI template that can be used to generate a unique identifier (`@id`) for every event described by the schedule. This property is required if the data provider is supporting third-party booking via the Open Booking API, or providing complimentary individual `subEvent`s.

This property can be used on: [`pending:Schedule`](https://pending.schema.org/Schedule)

This property may include the values: [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text)
